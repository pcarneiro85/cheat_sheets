# Grouping Machine Learning Models

## Why?

* Total of ML algorithms > 100
* Total of use cases > 100

**It's important to understand ways to group them in order to decrease time-to-value by hastening the model selection process**

_*When you understand your data and the outcome you need to get from it, you can then quickly identify potential ML algorithms you can use, and the data*_
_*preprocessing steps will be probably required. This all helps to sharply decrease time-to-value.*_
