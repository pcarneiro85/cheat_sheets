### To markdow a command:

I don't understand well what does the command `document.getElementByld()` from JavaScript language does.



### To write pieces of code:

Look my Python code:

```
num = int(input('Type value: ')
if num %2 == 0;
    print(f'The value {num} is even)
else:
    print(f'The value {num} is odd)
```
I can also take a printscreen of my code and paste it here like previously shown.



### Using Emojis

Hello World (use space after last word followed by`:` After the `:` start typing the emoji you'd like to use and press enter)
This is my emoji ðŸ––

[Acess Ikatyang's Emoji-Cheat-Sheet Repository Here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)



### If I want to use emoji in other places that don't accept markdown code:

[Access Emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/)
Choose the emoji category you'd like to use and search for the emoji you want to use. Look for "**Copy and paste this emoji:**" and click **copy**. Then paste it on where you want it.
